# Basic-Cooking-App
Many people enjoy cooking, but not everyone has the necessary knowledge or skills to prepare delicious and healthy meals. Design and develop a cooking application that allows users to search for recipes, create grocery lists, and track their cooking progress. The application should have a user-friendly interface and be able to perform the following functions:

Recipe Search: The user should be able to search for recipes based on keywords, ingredients, or cuisine types.

Recipe Details: The user should be able to view the details of a recipe, including ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information.

Grocery List: The user should be able to create a grocery list based on the ingredients needed for the selected recipe(s).

Cooking Progress: The user should be able to mark the steps they have completed while cooking a recipe and keep track of the cooking progress.
